# Building a Simple Diabetes Help Bot Using Streamlit and OpenAI

As technology continues to advance, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into various applications becomes increasingly prevalent. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the creation of a simple Diabetes Help Bot using the Streamlit framework and OpenAI's language model.

## Introduction

The Diabetes Help Bot is designed to provide information related to diabetes based on user queries. The underlying technology uses OpenAI's language model, which is capable of generating human-like responses. The user interacts with the bot through a user-friendly web interface created using Streamlit.

## Setting Up the Environment

Let's start by setting up our environment. The code snippet below imports the necessary libraries and sets the OpenAI API key:

```python
import os
from constants import openai_key
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

import streamlit as st

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = openai_key
```

Make sure to replace `openai_key` with your actual OpenAI API key, and ensure that you have the required Python packages installed.

## Creating the Streamlit Web Interface

The next section sets up the Streamlit web application. The title is set using `st.title('Diabetes Help Bot')`, and user input is captured with `st.text_input("Ask about diabetic-related topics: Ask about diet? Blood Sugar Level? Complications?")`.

```python
st.title('Diabetes Help Bot')
input_text = st.text_input("Ask about diabetic-related topics: Ask about diet? Blood Sugar Level? Complications?")
```

This allows users to interact with the bot by entering questions or topics related to diabetes.

## Defining Prompt Templates and Memory

The code then defines a template for the initial input prompt and sets up memory for storing the conversation history:

```python
first_input_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=['prompt'],
    template="reply this question {prompt} in the context of a diabetic patient."
)

person_memory = ConversationBufferMemory(input_key='prompt', memory_key='chat_history')
```

This is crucial for maintaining context in the conversation, enabling a more natural flow of information.

## Building the Language Model Chain

The language model chain is constructed using OpenAI's language model and the defined prompt template:

```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.8)
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=first_input_prompt, verbose=True)
```

This establishes the foundation for generating responses based on user input.

## Responding to User Input

Finally, the code checks if there is user input and, if present, runs the language model chain and displays the result:

```python
if input_text:
    st.write(chain.run(input_text))
```

This ensures that the bot provides responses only when the user inputs a question or topic.

## Conclusion

Building a Diabetes Help Bot involves combining powerful AI capabilities with a user-friendly interface. Through the use of Streamlit and OpenAI, we can create a responsive and informative bot that engages users in a conversational manner.

This tutorial serves as a starting point for those interested in exploring AI-driven applications and natural language processing. Experiment with different prompts, adjust parameters, and enhance the functionality to meet specific requirements.
